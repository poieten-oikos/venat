Provide open source ffxiv community discord bot that's incredibly easy to self-host.

## Description

We aim to offer the following features:
- Provide moderation and role management.
- Provide integrations with popular ffxiv services and streaming sites.
- Provide fun community features like music, games, and give-aways.
- Provide admin dashboard for managing the bot.

We are working towards building this in a modular way, so that you can pick and choose what features you need for 
your server. This modular approach should also allow Venat to be extended to other game communities in the future.
